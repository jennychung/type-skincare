        Depending on who you ask, having a skin care routine could mean a million different things. Is it putting on the occasional acne-fighting sheet mask? Lining up all 18 of your expensive serums for the perfect #shelfie? Reading and somehow understanding
        the textbook of an ingredients list on every product? Or is it carefully applying *juuuuust* the right amount of prescription cream to calm down a patch of psoriasis without feeling too greasy?
        <br> <br> The truth is, of course, that it can be all of the above--and each skin-care routine is necessarily as unique and individual as the person following it (or attempting to, anyway). But as skin care has become trendier and its definition
        has become wider in scope, it's also gotten a little more intimidating and confusing for a beginner to get started.
        <br> <br>That's where we come in. As you begin your skin-care quest, we hope to answer here in this skin-care 101 guide as many of your questions as we can--with the help of research and experts rather than hype.
        <br> <br>Let's get started!

    <div class="start6span4">
      Before figuring out what to include in your skin-care routine, it's important to know your skin type and if you have any major concerns you want to address. It's also good to remember that everyone's regimen is individual-- what works for your friends
      or family or randos online may not be best for you.
      <br> <br> To figure out your skin type, think about how your skin acts without any makeup or products on it a few hours after taking a shower. If it gets a little greasy or shiny, you probably have oily skin. If it feels dry or flaky, you have dry
      skin. If you have dry skin in some places and oily skin in others (usually on the T-zone), you have combination skin. If you have none of those things, you're considered to have "normal" skin. Knowing your skin type will help steer you towards products
      that will manage dryness and oiliness while effectively taking care of any other skin concerns you have.
      <br> <br> If your skin tends to get irritated when you use certain products, if you've ever had an allergic reaction to a product, or if you have certain skin conditions on your face (eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, etc.) you may have sensitive skin.
      People with sensitive skin can have oily, dry, combination, or normal skin too, but may need to take extra care in selecting products that don't cause irritation or exacerbate skin conditions.
      <br> <br> You don't necessarily need to see a dermatologist before starting a skin-care routine. But if you have sensitive skin (or aren't sure if your skin qualifies as sensitive), if you have a skin condition, or if you're trying to address any
      major concerns (such as stubborn or severe acne or hyperpigmentation), it's important to check in withÂ a board-certified dermatologist who can guide you through the process.

    <div class="sectionTitle start3span4"  id="Basics">
      OK, got it. So what are the basic steps of a skin-care routine?
    </div>

    <!-- BASICS -->
    <div class="start5span4">
      Skin care doesn't have to be complicated if you don't want it to be. The three basic steps of a skin-care routine are cleansing, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen (at least SPF 30 and broad spectrum). You should cleanse then moisturize every morning
      and night. You should also apply sunscreen every morning, but you can use a moisturizer that has at least 30 SPF and broad spectrum protection to combine those two steps. You can use a daytime moisturizer with SPF at night too although you may find
      that a thicker product is more moisturizing and better suited to nighttime use because you don't need to worry about being able to put makeup over it--plus, you don't need to worry about SPF while you're sleeping.
      <br> <br>If you wear heavy makeup or sunscreen during the day, you may find that your cleanser doesn't get all your makeup off or still leaves you feeling kind of greasy. In that case, you might benefit from double cleansing, a process in which
      you wash first with an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser or micellar water on a cotton pad to remove anything left behind. But double cleansing is not a requirement.
      <br> <br>Serums, toners, exfoliants, and prescription treatments should be applied after cleansing but before moisturizing.

    <!-- AGING -->
    <div class="start5span4" id="Aging">
      <p class="sectionTitle"> &#9656; Signs of Aging </p>
      <p class="body"> Some common signs of aging include photodamage dark spots, fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Retinoids: </h3>
      <p class="body"> These compounds--retinol, retinal (or retinaldehyde), retinoic acid, and synthetic retinoids like Adapalene and Tazerac--are one of only two proven ways to prevent the signs of aging. (The other is sunscreen!) Retinoids, which are forms of vitamin
        A, work by stimulating the skin cell-shedding process from below, leading to smoother skin and a reduction in both signs of aging and acne. These come in both prescription and over-the-counter products, so if you aren't satisfied with the results
        of an over-the-counter option, check with a dermatologist about getting a prescription version. Retinoids are also notorious for causing irritation when you first start using them, so it's crucial to apply them just a few days a week to start
        with and to apply a moisturizer right after using them.</p>
      <br>
      <h3> Sunscreen:</h3>
      <p class="body">You've likely used a sunscreen before to prevent sunburns, which are one form of UV damage. But did you know that UV rays can also contribute to other kinds of damage? And that damage can cause dark spots, wrinkles, and other signs of aging? It's
        true. Preventing that--and skin cancer, of course--is a major reason to use sunscreen every single day. Be sure to use a sunscreen that's at least SPF 30 and provides broad spectrum protection, meaning it protects against both UVA and UVB rays.
        Although the sunscreen in your makeup doesn't count as your daily SPF, the sunscreen in your moisturizer can--as long as you use it on your ears and neck as well as your face. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Niacinamide:</h3>
      <p class="body"> This is a form of vitamin B3 (niacin) that can be applied to the skin. There is some research to suggest that it can be helpful for managing acne, rosacea, and signs of aging including hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles. </p>

      <br>
      <h3> Ceramides: </h3>
      <p class="body">Ceramides are intercellular lipids, meaning they fill in the spaces between your skin cells in the stratum corneum (the outer protective layer of skin). Your skin already makes ceramides on its own--without them, your skin won't be able to effectively
        hold moisture in or keep irritants out. Topical ceramides may be present in both prescription treatments for eczema and over-the-counter products.</p>
      <br>
      <h3> Vitamin C:</h3>
      <p class="body"> Yes, that vitamin C! This vitamin is essential for producing collagen and other important compounds in the body. And when it's applied topically it can function as an antioxidant, thus preventing UV-related damage. It can also inhibit the production
        of melanin (pigment) in the skin, making it a good option for lightening dark spots due to photoaging or other kinds of damage. But beware that all forms of vitamin C are not created equally--some are more or less effective or stable than others.
        Vitamin C often appears on the label as these derivatives--look for ingredients such as magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl 6-palmitate, ascorbic acid sulfate, or L-ascorbic acid (also referred to simply as ascorbic acid).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ACNE -->
    <div class="start5span4" id="Acne">
      <p class="sectionTitle"> &#9656; Acne </p>
      <p class="body"> Although it's very common, acne is a lot more complicated than most of us realize. For instance, there are different types of pimples (whiteheads, blackheads, etc.), which may be inflamed (red, swollen, painful) or not. Acne can also be influenced
        by many factors in your life, such as your hormones. So if your acne is severe or if your over-the-counter treatment options aren't helping, it's important to see a dermatologist who may be able to prescribe you something more effective. </p>

      <h3> Chemical Exfoliants: </h3>
      <p class="body"> You may already be familiar with physical exfoliants such as scrubs and brushes. And while those are perfectly effective at removing dead skin that can clog pores, they're not exactly gentle. That's why many dermatologists recommend their patients stick with chemical exfoliants, which include both alpha hydroxy acids, or AHAs (such as lactic acid and glycolic acid) and beta hydroxy acids, or BHAs (essentially just salicylic acid). Rather than physically scrubbing the dead skin cells off your face, these break down the bonds between those cells so that you can easily wipe them away. They're present in all kinds of products, including cleansers, toners, masks, and serums.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Benzoyl Peroxide:</h3>
      <p class="body">Unlike salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide can kill the type of bacteria that's often responsible for inflamed acne. That's why it's often recommended to use both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid to help manage mild to moderate acne. For more severe
        acne, a retinoid or other prescription treatment may be necessary. Both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide can also irritate or dry out skin, so it's important to also use a moisturizer when you're using these ingredients. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Niacinamide:</h3>
      <p class="body"> This is a form of vitamin B3 (niacin) that can be applied to the skin. There is some research to suggest that it can be helpful for managing acne, rosacea, and signs of aging including hyperpigmentation, fine lines, and wrinkles. Ceramides: Ceramides
        are intercellular lipids, meaning they fill in the spaces between your skin cells in the stratum corneum (the outer protective layer of skin). Your skin already makes ceramides on its own--without them, your skin won't be able to effectively hold
        moisture in or keep irritants out. Topical ceramides may be present in both prescription treatments for eczema and over-the-counter products.</p>
      <br>
      <h3> Azelaic Acid:</h3>
      <p class="body"> A type of acid synthesized by yeast, barley, and wheat that's believed to have a gentle exfoliating effect. Research has shown that it's effective at managing both acne and acne-like bumps that are a common symptom of rosacea. It comes in prescription
        and over-the-counter forms.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SCARS -->
    <div class="start5span4" id="Scars">
      <p class="sectionTitle"> &#9656; Scars and discoloration + hyperpigmentation </p>
      <p class="body"> For some people, scars are almost a badge of honor or a physical mark that shows you endured an intense event. But others would rather not have them hanging around. And if you're trying to minimize the appearance of a scar, the first thing to know
        is that you'll have to be patient--and especially skeptical.
        <br><br> Over-the-counter topical scar treatments don't have a ton of evidence behind them, unfortunately. What does work? Moisturizing--almost to an excessive degree--and time. If that doesn't help, you should chat with a dermatologist about
        your other options, which may include prescription topical treatments or laser treatments.
        <br><br> When it comes to dark spots, melasma, or other hyperpigmentation concerns, though, you can try brightening ingredients, like vitamin C and hydroquinone. </p>

      <br>
      <h3> Vitamin C:</h3>
      <p class="body"> Yes, that vitamin C! This vitamin is essential for producing collagen and other important compounds in the body. And when it's applied topically it can function as an antioxidant, thus preventing UV-related damage. It can also inhibit the production
        of melanin (pigment) in the skin, making it a good option for lightening dark spots due to photoaging or other kinds of damage. But beware that all forms of vitamin C are not created equally--some are more or less effective or stable than others.

        with and to apply a moisturizer right after using them.</p>

      <br>
      <h3> Sunscreen:</h3>
      <p class="body">Prevents dark spots from getting darker. <br> You've likely used a sunscreen before to prevent sunburns, which are one form of UV damage. But did you know that UV rays can also contribute to other kinds of damage? And that damage can cause dark
        spots, wrinkles, and other signs of aging? It's true. Preventing that--and skin cancer, of course--is a major reason to use sunscreen every single day. Be sure to use a sunscreen that's at least SPF 30 and provides broad spectrum protection, meaning

      <br>
      <h3> Hydroquinone:</h3>
      <p class="body"> Considered the gold standard of brightening ingredients, hydroquinone is available over-the-counter at (concentrations of up to 2 percent) and via prescription in higher strengths.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- DRY -->
    <div class="start5span4" id="Dry">
      <p class="sectionTitle"> &#9656; Dry & Sensitive </p>
      <p class="body"> Dry skin also tends to be sensitive, and dry skin can also be a symptom of skin conditions that make the skin more sensitive, like eczema. So products for dry skin are often suitable for sensitive skin as well--but not always.
        <br> <br>If you have sensitive skin (meaning you are prone to irritation or allergic reactions or have a skin condition like eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea), it's especially important to be aware that products containing things like parabens and
        fragrances are more likely to cause a reaction. It's also a good idea to patch-test any new product on your inner arm before using it all over your face. </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Vitamin C:</h3>
        <p class="body"> Yes, that vitamin C! This vitamin is essential for producing collagen and other important compounds in the body. And when it's applied topically it can function as an antioxidant, thus preventing UV-related damage.

        <br>
        <h3> Squalane Oil: </h3>
        <p class="body"> Squalane is a light moisturizing oil that mimics a component of sebum, the oily substance our skin produces. There is limited research on the effect of topical squalane on skin, but in general it acts like an emollient when applied, which means that it can squeeze into the spaces between skin cells and make your face feel smoother and more moisturized without being too heavy or occlusive.</p>
        <br>
        <h3> Hyaluronic Acid: </h3>
        <p class="body"> Hyaluronic acid is found naturally in the skin and acts as a humectant, meaning it can draw moisture into the skin; products with these molecules allow moisture to bind to the skin without feeling greasy or heavy.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="start6span4 centervertical">
      People of color are generally more susceptible to skin issues involving hyperpigmentation, such as melasma and post-acne dark spots. You may also be more likely to develop scarring or hyperpigmentation after inflammatory skin issues, like acne, psoriasis, or eczema.

      <br><br> That can be frustrating because treating pigmentation concerns in darker skin is often somewhat challenging with treatments that are commonly used on white skin, like laser treatments. But laser treatment techniques have advanced a lot in recent years, and in the hands of an experienced practitioner can be safely used in patients with skin of color. Additionally, topical treatments containing things like hydroquinone and vitamin C can help too. But whatever you do, know that treating hyperpigmentation takes time--possibly six months to a year.

      <br><br> There's also a prevalent myth that people with darker skin don't need to wear sunscreen--this is definitely not true! The sun can still cause damage even if you're not getting sunburned. And that damage can both lead to skin cancer and exacerbate hyperpigmentation. If you have any questions about how to care for your skin of color or about managing an issue like melasma, your best bet is to talk to a dermatologist.

<!-- PREGNANT -->
    <div class="start5span4" id="Pregnant">
      <p class="sectionTitle"> I'm pregnant. What products can I use and what should I avoid? </p>
      <p class="body"> When you're pregnant or breastfeeding, you may need to temporarily stop using certain products, especially certain acne products. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), pregnant people should definitely avoid using retinoids including isotretinoin, tretinoin, tazarotene, spironolactone, and adapalene. You should also be careful about certain antibiotics, such as doxycycline. Depending on your doctor's recommendations, you may also need to avoid or limit benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Instead, dermatologists often recommend pregnant people use azelaic acid to manage acne.

      <br><br>You should also be cautious about brightening ingredients, particularly hydroquinone. The use of this ingredient should also be stopped while you're pregnant.

      <br><br>In general, though, we don't have a ton of information about how these (and honestly most) medications affect pregnant people, the AAD says. So many of these recommendations are based on an absence of conclusive evidence that they are safe rather than having evidence that they're definitely harmful.

      <br><br>Above all it's important to check in with your doctor or dermatologist before using something on your skin when pregnant or breastfeeding because they can assess your individual skin situation and help you figure out what makes sense for you.

        <p class="body"> If you have a skin condition (such as rosacea, psoriasis, eczema, or severe acne) or any condition that affects your skin, it's important for you to see a dermatologist and make your skin-care decisions with their input. Not only is your skin likely to be more sensitive to skin-care products, you also don't want to do anything that might exacerbate the underlying condition.

        <br><br>Plus if you're trying to manage that condition, you can only go so far with over-the-counter products. Sometimes they can get the job done (like using a drugstore cleanser containing salicylic acid for mild acne), but you want to be sure that you're not overlooking another option that may be more effective, like a prescription retinoid.

        <br><br>So over-the-counter products aren't off-limits for you entirely, but you will want to approach them with caution. It may be wise for you to do patch-tests (putting a small amount of a new product on your inner arm for a day or two) before using anything new, or your dermatologist can perform a formal test in their office to see which ingredients you're likely to be sensitive to. With the right approach, skin care can be an effective (and maybe even fun!) way to manage the symptoms of your condition.

<!-- CLEAN -->
        <div class="start5span4" id="Clean">
          <p class="sectionTitle"> What about "clean" beauty? How do I make sure everything in my skin-care routine is safe? </p>
          <p class="body"> Considering how little the FDA is involved in regulating cosmetic skin-care ingredients, it's understandable that you'd want to do whatever you can to make sure you're only putting the safest ingredients possible on your skin.

          <br><br>But, today, words like clean and natural are more buzzwords than anything else. These terms don't have agreed-upon definitions and aren't regulated by the FDA, so any company can define clean beauty however it wants and give itself that label.

          <br><br>It's also important to remember that just because something is natural doesn't mean it's safe. In fact, natural herbal and botanical ingredients are frequently irritants and allergens for those with sensitive skin. And our health concerns about certain chemicals in makeup and skin-care products are often overblown.

          <br><br>Moreover, herbal and botanical ingredients (which are still chemicals btw) aren't necessarily analogous to the compounds tested in clinical trials. For instance, rosehip contains vitamin A, but isn't the same thing as retinol or retinoic acid, so you don't necessarily know how much vitamin A you're putting on your face or what kinds of effects you can expect.

          <br><br>So again we recommend opting for products that contain ingredients we know the most about. And if you're not sure if something is right for your skin, talk to a dermatologist.
